                <h2 class="section-heading">About Us</h2>
                <p>All Holy Homies was created out of a desire to better know the holy men and women who loved Christ with their whole selves. The name comes from the Litany of Saints, when Christians ask, <strong>“All holy men and women, pray for us!”</strong> This, combined with the idea that the saints can be our close friends, homies even, helped give All Holy Homies its name. We strive to create fun necklaces with beachy vibes that incorporates the well-researched colors associated with the life of each saint they bear. Each necklace is handcrafted individually as a true labor of love, with you and your prayer intentions in mind! In addition to our standard necklaces, we can create custom designs based around your favorite or patron saints, favorite colors, different sizes, or medals that you already have that mean a lot to you. Please check our <a href="#FAQs">FAQs</a> for more information.</p>

Depending on how difficult they are to find, we may need to order a custom engraved medal. If this is the case we will contact you with a full cost disclosure before we place a custom engraving order.</p>
